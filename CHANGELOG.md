# changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project aims at [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Version boundaries before 1.2.0 are reconstructed from git history rather than
release tags, so the grouping is approximate. Anything older than 1.0.0 is
condensed.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `long-horizon-swarm` skill: the `long-horizon` contract with Opus, Sol and Astra
  as peers who contribute ideas, critique and code throughout a run. It attaches to
  an existing run's state file, logs contributions and Codex spend in `swarm.md`, and
  reports disagreements to the user instead of blocking on them. The per-round
  auditor stays fresh and never sees swarm output. Each peer works through a lens,
  either a swarm lens in `lenses/` (starting with `done-check`) or an existing skill's
  criteria. Authors reply to critique before the host acts, any peer can execute a
  round, and `references/codex-peer.md` holds the tested Windows copy and launch
  recipe. Revised from a live dogfood run of the skill on itself. Claude Code only.

### Removed

- The `merge` skill leaves the template. Session-wide auto-merge is a personal
  authorization policy, not a repository one, so it now lives as a global skill in
  `~/.claude/skills/merge`. The kernel's squash-by-default and one-PR-per-unit rules
  are unchanged.

### Changed

- Codex has two accepted routes: a ChatGPT login, or a `model_provider` gateway set in
  `config.toml` in `$CODEX_HOME` (default `~/.codex`), for example a CLIProxyAPI gateway
  over subscription accounts. `codex-review` and `codex-fullreview` accept either without
  a caveat, record which one ran, and stop only when neither holds. The agent never adds,
  changes or switches a provider or key itself. When a gateway is set it carries the
  requests, whatever `codex login status` says. `arena`, `long-horizon-swarm`,
  `long-horizon` and `long-horizon-workflows` use the same two routes to decide whether
  Codex joins.
- `perf-loop` starts with a triage pass when the request names no target. It measures
  every applicable dimension (loading, delivery size, rendering, input response, memory,
  service latency, CPU and disk), compares each with a budget or labeled reference,
  names the top contributor, and presents a ranked table. The skill then stops until the
  user picks the focus. A request that names a target skips triage. Triage numbers never
  serve as the acceptance baseline. The method lives in `references/triage.md`. The
  skill body and its triage, rendering, loading and services references are rewritten
  in compressed Caveman style, about 15% smaller, with every rule kept.
  `evidence-report.md` is unchanged because it must match the `wow-loop` copy.
- `.claude/reference/pitfalls.md` ships empty, like the other reference files. Its
  entries were the template's own accumulated gotchas: its tooling and README panels, its
  maintainer's machine, and general lessons such as escaping JSON inside `<script>`, stale
  preview servers and background server ports. Each one was copied into every repository
  created from the template. The kernel's browser rule no longer points at it for detail.
- A skill folder that `scripts/readme/items.json` does not list no longer produces a
  README warning. The README still leaves it out until it is listed.
- Adding or removing a skill no longer fails a check. Codex sync, the capability and
  contract checks, the doctor, and the README verify step and tests now warn and exit 0
  for a missing or unregistered skill, a missing dependency, a retired skill that
  reappears (the warning names its replacement), adapter drift, a stale capability
  catalog, and a README that differs from a fresh build, including hand edits. CI shows
  the warnings as annotations. A check still fails when a file cannot be read: invalid
  JSON in a manifest, the removal record, or settings, or a `SKILL.md` without
  frontmatter or a description. `verify.mjs` builds into a scratch directory and no
  longer rewrites the committed README. README tests check a fresh build instead of the
  committed files and no longer pin the template's skill counts.
- README counts read naturally at one ("1 workflow", "browse the only skill") and leave
  out empty groups; group counts and the narrow memory map follow the skills installed.
  After a rebuild, the quickstart, the "what the firmware adds" table, and the feedback
  loop text name only installed skills. The template's own README is unchanged.
- Check failures caused by unreadable JSON print one line naming the file instead of a
  stack trace. Codex sync generates no adapter for a retired skill, and each warning
  appears once in CI.

- General Writing now checks evidence and reader understanding before style, scopes
  clarity and style verdicts, and allows explanations to follow reader needs. Claude
  and Codex each ship a complete standalone package with local references and licenses.

- Every Codex skill is now a maintained native skill. The 14 that were generated
  adapters (`adopt-repo`, `advocate`, `arena`, `astra-review`, `automate-me`,
  `babysit-ci`, `claude-review`, `codex-review`, `dare`, `forge-repo-ui-skill`, `lab`,
  `optimize-context`, `session-hub`, `sync-starter`) no longer tell Codex to read the
  Claude workflow. Each is written for Codex: exposed agents with fresh context that
  fail closed, `update_plan` and direct questions instead of Claude-only tools,
  `~/.codex/sessions/` for `automate-me`, and the same-vendor disclosure when
  `codex-review` or `astra-review` runs from Codex. Supporting files for
  `forge-repo-ui-skill` and `session-hub` now sit beside their Codex skill. The Claude
  skills are unchanged, and a new skill without a native version still gets a generated
  adapter.
- `refine` gates edits on three checks before changing anything: the failure is
  attributable to an instruction, tool, or configuration; the causal link is stated from
  evidence; and the rule being changed was active in the failure. It also checks what the
  agent saw and remembered before blaming instructions. Informed by ModularRSI's
  failure-mode checklist, in original wording.
- Evidence workflows package compact reports and comparable before/after presentation.
  Design, planning and review workflows add selective shared-code refactoring guidance
  for Claude and Codex, with standalone resources and existing authorization preserved.
- Skill authoring now starts with `addskill`; `writing-skills` discovery is retired
  with authoring resources and licenses preserved. Caveman includes Unslop, with
  explicit prose and code cleanup retained after standalone Unslop retirement.
- Claude and Codex workflows align evidence, independent review, authorization,
  runtime discovery and selective native propagation. Claude gains `perf-loop`.
- Capability coverage, resources, ownership and retirement now have a manifest
  and regression checks. Older disabled retirement entries remain compatible;
  startup and contributor guidance follow the consolidated routes.
- Existing projects receive explicit retirement migration steps, a native Codex
  drift reminder, and optional-settings compatibility in copy and README tooling.

- `writing` skill: pattern 31 carries the Latinate-dress-up trap table
  from Corewise.Academy `plain-words` (prohibition → ban, verbatim →
  word-for-word, and so on) plus the what-never-changes list; the
  plain-words rule in SKILL.md names the swaps. Pattern 5 labels its
  After text as citing a source the writer already had, so the example
  no longer reads as permission to invent one.

### Added

- A removal record, `.agents/removed-skills.json`, for skills a project deletes on
  purpose. A missing skill listed there produces no warning. The new `removal` block
  in `.agents/skill-capabilities.json` names the skills the template expects every
  project to keep (`init-project`, `external-review`) and which skills need others.
- `external-review`, a Codex-only leaf review: one reviewer, one fresh context, one
  exact diff scope, no agents or edits. `codex-review` and `astra-review` in both
  runtimes now launch it through a custom prompt when the reviewed repository has it,
  and fall back to the `--base`/`--commit`/`--uncommitted` selector with Codex's
  built-in rubric when it does not. New Claude skills `codex-fullreview` (Sol, high)
  and `astra-fullreview` (Astra, medium) run a full multi-agent review instead: plain
  `codex exec` runs `impartial-review` as Manager with fresh-context sub-reviewers,
  and the launcher counts the spawns from the Codex session file and reports a
  zero-spawn run as "no sub-reviewers ran". They use more Codex usage than the
  single-context launchers.
- `long-horizon-workflows` skill: the `long-horizon` contract with each round's
  baseline, executor, inspector and judges run as one Workflow script, so audit
  agents cannot inherit Manager context, verdicts are schema enums, and the run
  journal records every agent's input and output. Judge count is chosen per round.
  Claude Code only; Codex keeps `long-horizon`.
- `scripts/lib/launch-chrome.mjs`: headed Chrome launcher that puts the
  window on a display the operator is not using and hands the keyboard
  back, so the real-GPU browser rule stops interrupting them.
- `refine` skill: post-task pass that mines the session for friction and
  commits the smallest edit that prevents a repeat (concept port of
  prime-agent's Continual Harness).
- `long-horizon` skill: Manager/Executor/Auditor rounds with audit-gated
  durable state for tasks bigger than one context window (concept port of
  AMAP-ML's LongHorizon-Harness).
- `writing` skill: one skill for text that leaves the session (docs,
  READMEs, site and UI copy, emails) and for editing or auditing a draft
  for AI tells. Adds the rhetoric patterns from petergyang/no-ai-slop
  (throat-clearing openers, faux-insight setups, colon reveals, kickers)
  and its edit-mode restraint (minimum effective edit, keep real hedges).

### Changed

- Codex planning, review, authorization, and recovery workflows have clearer scope and
  verification rules. `addskill` and `fable-mode` now have native bodies registered in
  `.agents/skill-modes.json`. Claude workflows and existing disabled choices are preserved.
- A read-only copy checker detects drift in explicitly selected personal skill roots;
  maintenance documentation covers backup, reconciliation, and discovery checks.

- `README.md`: the safety model section became "what's different here", the
  template's differentiators; the safety rules moved to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  beside the PR checklist that enforces them.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `caveman`, `session-start.sh`: the always-on core-tells
  digest now points at `writing/patterns.md` instead of the removed
  `unslop` skill.

### Removed

- `humanizer`, `purposeful-writing`, `unslop` skills and the
  `bootstrap/machine/home-claude/skills/writing` copy, folded into
  `writing`. The always-on digest in `CLAUDE.md` and `caveman` is
  unchanged.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- Renamed the project to **Harness Firmware**. The name describes what the
  layer configures: the agent harness (Claude Code, Codex), not a model. The
  repository URL is unchanged. Machine identifiers (plugin `name`, skill
  namespaces) are unchanged so existing installs keep working.
- Restructured `README.md` around what the layer is, how to install it, and
  what it costs to keep loaded.
- `/init-project` now asks which prose mode a project wants instead of assuming
  silently. `caveman ultra` remains the inherited default; `lite`, `full`, and
  `normal` are one answer away, and `README.md` documents changing it later.
  The skill also offers a minimal skill preset for projects that want a small
  always-loaded surface.

### Added

- POSIX bootstrap script, so setup works from a plain shell without PowerShell.
- `doctor.mjs`, a preflight check for a checkout: the SessionStart hook is
  wired, skill frontmatter parses, generated Codex adapters are in sync, the
  reference library is complete, plugin manifests parse, no `FILL IN` markers
  survived, and the always-loaded context weight is reported.
- Community files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and GitHub issue
  templates for bug reports and skill proposals.

### Fixed

- Frontmatter parsers in `sync-codex-skills.mjs` and `test-codex-contract.mjs`
  did not recognize `>-` block scalars, which made the `perf` skill
  undiscoverable in Codex and hid its description-length violation from CI.
  Both parsers are fixed and the `perf` description now fits the 240-char
  contract limit.

## [1.1.3]

### Fixed

- `/sync-starter` guards the spawn-critical surface (`bootstrap/`,
  `.claude/hooks/`, `settings.json`) from direct-to-main commits and ships the
  post-squash branch re-sync fix to plugin installs.

## [1.1.2]

### Added

- `perf` skill: a measurement rig for web performance work, so changes to
  bundling, preload hints, and lazy loading get measured instead of assumed.
- Steering levers adopted from `mattpocock/skills` across the core skills.
- PASS/FAIL verdict step in the `writing` skill.
- The global `writing` skill is now tracked by the home-claude bootstrap.

### Fixed

- The `merge` skill re-syncs the session branch after each squash merge, so a
  commit pushed after a merge is no longer stranded off `main`.
- The bootstrap `writing` skill is ASCII-only, which unbreaks validation on
  `main`.
- Restored the squash-merge default and the one-open-PR reuse rule in the
  `merge` skill.

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md` allows plan-mode popups (`ExitPlanMode`, `AskUserQuestion`).

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- Unified project generator for spawning a configured repo.
- Visual project creator UI (`new-claude-project-ui`).
- Codex hardening for spawned projects: `AGENTS.md` owns Codex runtime safety
  and tool translation, and generated adapters live in `.agents/skills/`.
- Pitfall entry: verify local preview servers before trusting them.

### Changed

- Trimmed the `CLAUDE.md` kernel down to cross-cutting rules; topical detail
  moved to `.claude/reference/`.
- Pointed template references at the renamed repository.

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- `fable-mode` skill for layered work with dependent steps and
  verification-sensitive handoff.
- `purposeful-writing` skill, folding in the best of `humanizer`.

### Fixed

- `addskill` lands a new skill on `main` via the merge flow instead of leaving
  it on a branch.

## [0.x]

Earlier history condensed: the initial kernel, the on-demand skill system,
committed project memory under `.claude/reference/`, session hooks, the Codex
skill sync scripts, and the first pass at context-weight accounting.
