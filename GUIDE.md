# Harness Firmware guide

Harness Firmware can add a skill library to an existing repository or create a project with the complete operating layer. This guide covers the detailed setup and maintenance paths. The [README](README.md) stays focused on evaluation and quick installation.

## full template

Use the full template when a project needs the rule kernel, hooks, committed memory, skills, and starter synchronization.

- GitHub UI: select **Use this template**, create a repository, clone it, open it in Claude Code, then run `/init-project`.
- macOS or Linux: `bash bootstrap/new-claude-project.sh --name my-app --dest ~/code`
- Windows one-click: double-click `bootstrap/New-ClaudeProject.cmd`.
- Windows CLI: `.\bootstrap\new-claude-project.ps1 -Name my-app -Dest C:\code`
- Windows visual launcher: download and extract [`New-ClaudeProject-UI.zip`](https://github.com/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware/releases/latest/download/New-ClaudeProject-UI.zip), then double-click `New-ClaudeProject-UI.cmd`.

Keep the extracted Windows launcher, PowerShell module, and `template/` folder together. The bundled snapshot supports local-only project creation without GitHub access.

`/init-project` detects the stack, asks a short set of unresolved questions, fills the verification and deployment sections, seeds reference files, prunes irrelevant skills, removes spawn-only files, and prepares the result for verification.

Two setup choices affect every later session:

- **Prose mode:** `caveman ultra` is the template default. Choose `normal`, `lite`, or `full` during setup to change it.
- **Skill preset:** `full` keeps every skill. `minimal` keeps the core loop and quality disciplines, then asks before removing situational tools.

Git writes still follow the active runtime's safety rules and the user's authorization.

## Codex

1. Open the repository in Codex.
2. Let Codex read `AGENTS.md` as its instruction boundary.
3. Use `.claude/reference/` for shared project knowledge.
4. Let Codex discover its native skills under `.agents/skills/`.
5. Do not run Claude hooks or inherit Claude automatic Git behavior unless the user explicitly asks in the current Codex session.

For a new project, ask Codex to initialize the starter or select its native `init-project` skill. It uses the Codex instruction boundary and shared project facts.

## prose mode

The template answers in terse `caveman ultra` by default. Replies drop filler while code, commands, identifiers, and error strings stay intact. Security warnings and irreversible confirmations use plain prose.

Two files assert the default and must agree:

- `CLAUDE.md`, under `## Default prose mode: caveman ultra`.
- `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, in the three marked caveman blocks.

To change the default later, replace `ultra` with `lite` or `full` in both files. To remove the default, delete the marked section and hook blocks. The `caveman` skill remains available on demand.

For one session, say `stop caveman` or `normal mode`.

Check both files afterward:

```bash
grep -rn caveman CLAUDE.md .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
```

Either nothing returns or the same level appears everywhere.

## check the installation

Run:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/doctor.mjs
```

The doctor checks hook wiring, skill frontmatter, that every Claude skill has a registered native or disabled Codex version and that native ports are in sync with their Claude source, skill coverage, the reference library, plugin manifests, leftover `FILL IN` markers, and always-loaded context weight.

## add or remove skills

Removing a skill never fails a check. Adding or changing a Claude skill fails `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --check`, locally and in CI, until its Codex side is settled: a new skill needs a `native` or `disabled` entry in `.agents/skill-modes.json`, and a changed skill needs its Codex port updated and `node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --baseline <name>` run. Otherwise the checks warn about what they notice and exit 0, locally, in the doctor, and in CI, where warnings show up as annotations on the run. Beyond that, only a file the tools cannot read fails: invalid JSON in a manifest, the removal record, or settings; a `SKILL.md` without frontmatter or a description; or a check script that crashes.

What produces a warning:

- A registered skill that is missing from a runtime. The warning suggests recording it or restoring it.
- A skill that needs another one that is not installed, for example `astra-review` without `codex-review`. The warning names both.
- A skill folder that `.agents/skill-capabilities.json` does not register yet.
- A retired skill that reappears, such as `verify-this`. The warning names the skill that replaced it; delete the folder unless you mean to bring it back.
- A README or README image that no longer matches a fresh build, including hand edits. Run `node scripts/readme/build.mjs` to rebuild it.

To remove a skill on purpose and keep the checks quiet about it:

1. Delete `.claude/skills/<name>/` and `.agents/skills/<name>/`, whichever exist.
2. Add the name to `.agents/removed-skills.json`, sorted, each name once:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 1,
     "removed": ["lab", "why"]
   }
   ```

3. Run `node scripts/readme/build.mjs` so the README stops listing it, then `node .claude/scripts/doctor.mjs`.

harnessfirmware.com/new does steps 1 and 2 for every skill you untick and sets each name to `"off"` under `skillOverrides` in `.claude/settings.json`. A new repository keeps the template's README until the first `node scripts/readme/build.mjs`; until then the README still links the removed skills, and the README check warns that it is stale.

The record is informational. A missing skill listed in it produces no warning; a missing skill left out of it produces one. `node .claude/scripts/removed-skills.mjs` prints the record and any warnings about it, such as a listed skill whose folder is still there.

The `removal` block in `.agents/skill-capabilities.json` describes the template's intent. `required` names the skills the template expects every project to keep: `init-project` and `external-review`. `dependencies` names skills that need others; for example `astra-review` reads `codex-review`. Breaking either produces a warning, not a failure.

Removing `addskill` leaves `.claude/skills/writing-skills/` and `.agents/skills/writing-skills/`. They hold licensed reference files from the retired `writing-skills` skill and have no `SKILL.md`, so no runtime loads them and no check requires them. Delete them by hand if you do not want them.

To bring a skill back, restore its folders from the template, for example `git checkout starter/main -- .claude/skills/<name> .agents/skills/<name>` (only the paths that exist upstream), then delete its name from the record and its `skillOverrides` entry. When you pull other template updates with `sync-starter`, skip paths under removed skills; the session-start drift notice already ignores them.

## measure the always-loaded layer

Run:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/context-weight.sh
```

The script measures the repository kernel, machine-global Claude instructions, and every injected skill name and description. It estimates tokens at four characters each. The result is a source-file trend measure, not runtime billing.

Skill bodies and reference files stay outside the always-loaded layer. They load only when a task routes to them. MCP tool definitions, marketplace descriptions, and machine auto-memory also sit outside the script's measurement.

The `minimal` preset physically removes confirmed skills. `skillOverrides` changes discovery but does not change the script's file count.

## work loop

The repository carries the loop:

1. `recall` reads the relevant project facts and dated pitfalls.
2. A matching skill supplies the longer workflow only when needed.
3. Project-specific verification records evidence.
4. `refine` maps observed friction to the smallest rule, memory, or workflow change that could prevent a repeat.
5. `sync-starter` can move a reviewed generic improvement into the template or pull a template improvement into a spawned project.

`optimize-context` removes guidance that no longer earns its per-turn cost.

For material workflow changes, `refine` records a baseline, fixed criteria, targeted and neighboring checks, and a rollback reference. Keep that [evaluation record](.agents/skills/refine/references/evaluation.md) with the task's evidence and link it from the refinement report or existing task state. The [Claude copy](.claude/skills/refine/references/evaluation.md) follows the same protocol. Ordinary wording fixes stay lightweight. Local acceptance, use by a later task, and measured improvement are separate claims; later use can remain pending. See the [research review](docs/research/2026-09-13-rsi-harness.md) for the rationale and limits.

## runtime boundaries

| Runtime | Entry point | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/` | Kernel rules, slash skills, project memory, session hook, plugin path, and Claude-specific workflow rules. |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/` | Explicit safety boundary and maintained native Codex skills. |

Every skill has a native Codex version maintained directly under `.agents/skills/` and registered in `.agents/skill-modes.json`, or is registered `disabled` when it needs Claude-only tools. There are no generated adapters. See [skill maintenance](docs/codex-skills.md) for ownership and personal-copy reconciliation. `AGENTS.md` defines the Codex safety boundary. Codex does not run Claude SessionStart hooks. Workflows that need unavailable tools remain capability-gated.

## repository map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code kernel loaded every turn. Spawned projects fill its verification and deployment sections. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex instruction and safety boundary. |
| `.claude/skills/` | Claude Code workflow playbooks. |
| `.agents/skills/` | Maintained native Codex skills. |
| `.agents/removed-skills.json` | Skills this project deleted on purpose. Checks stay quiet about the names it lists. |
| `.claude/reference/` | Committed project memory for architecture, commands, deployment, pitfalls, secrets, and technology choices. |
| `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` | Claude Code startup checks and reminders. |
| `.claude/scripts/context-weight.sh` | Always-loaded source weight measurement. |
| `.claude/scripts/doctor.mjs` | Installation health check. |
| `.claude/scripts/memory-audit.mjs` | Optional local Claude transcript usage counts for skills and memory. Counts are lower bounds, not proof that a resource is unused or ineffective. |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Claude hook wiring and Bash permission allowlist. |
| `.claude-plugin/` | Claude plugin and marketplace manifests used by the template. |
| `bootstrap/` | Project creation, fork retargeting, machine setup, and Windows launcher release files. |

## fork the template

Retarget functional upstream references to a fork:

```bash
bash bootstrap/retarget-fork.sh <you>/<your-fork>
```

Review the diff before committing. License attribution remains unchanged.

## machine-level Claude files

Files under `~/.claude` do not travel with a repository. Keep personal bootstrap copies under `bootstrap/machine/home-claude/` in a fork, then run:

```powershell
.\bootstrap\setup-machine.ps1
```

The script copies missing files. `-Force` overwrites. `-DryRun` previews.

## requirements

- Claude Code for the plugin workflow. The full template supports Claude Code or Codex.
- Codex reads `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/`; it does not run Claude SessionStart hooks.
- Node for the doctor, README generator, and Codex skill synchronization.
- `gh` CLI is optional for project creators.
- PowerShell bootstrap runs on Windows.
- POSIX bootstrap runs on macOS and Linux.
- The Claude session hook uses Bash and is validated on Ubuntu in CI.
